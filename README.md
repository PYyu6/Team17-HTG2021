Amidst COVID-19, existing inequities in healthcare systems have been exacerbated. 

Notably, homeless populations are deprioritized in healthcare outreach approaches regardless
whether it’s preventative or primary care. Homeless folks are also more likely to suffer from
chronic conditions, thus leaving them more vulnerable to COVID and more susceptible to severe 
cases of COVID-19. Thus, while there’s a community health need for solutions tackling COVID-19 
crisis care in the homeless population, there currently are no ways to tackle this mobile group.

We aim to address this issue by developing an app to help marginalized people find access to the
vaccine and COVID education so they can stay as safe as possible. Understanding that many marginalized
people may not have access to phones or a stable internet connection, we developed an SMS app in tandem
to allow people to access our app, regardless of the quality of technology and internet connection. We
used Machine Learning to develop a chatbot on the SMS service in order to curate high-quality resources
for homeless people across Canada. It is our hope that our app can get homeless people the help they need
to escape the streets.
